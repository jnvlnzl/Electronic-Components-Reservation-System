The Electronic Component Reservation System is designed to optimize the management of equipment and room reservations of the various electronic laboratories in the De La Salle University-Manila campus. 

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, this system offers a user-friendly interface that facilitates inventory viewing, searching, and updating. Key features include a search bar for quick item retrieval and dropdown filters for easy navigation through categories and components. The system enhances resource management efficiency by providing real-time visibility into item availability and streamlining reservation processes, thus ensuring accurate and effective control over campus resources. 

Instructions on the website's usage can be found in the "E-CORE_User Manual.pdf" file included in the repository.
